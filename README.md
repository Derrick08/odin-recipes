Welcome to **Odin Recipes**, a simple recipe website created as part of The Odin Project curriculum. This project showcases fundamental HTML skills by building a website that includes:

- Links to navigate between different recipe pages.  
- Unordered lists for organizing ingredient lists.  
- Ordered lists to outline step-by-step cooking instructions.  
- Images to visually enhance the recipes and make them more appealing.  

## Features

1. Interactive recipe pages with navigational links.  
2. Organized and easy-to-follow instructions for each recipe.  
3. High-quality images to accompany each dish.  

This project serves as a hands-on way to practice structuring HTML documents and using Git for version control. Explore delicious recipes while improving your web development skills!
